# web-scraping-for-rainbow6siege
Currently a work in progress - working on improving efficiency and creating a simple GUI to complement the original project. 


I was looking for an easier way to search players statistics on Rainbow Six Siege and to see how effective the matchmaking and ranked system is. Eventually I would like to create a GUI that is easier to navigate and cleaner than a command line. I also am working on adding other parameters to search for each player. 

In the long term, I may create a datatable with the data I collect and use it to analyze how effective/fair the matchmaking and ranking system of the game are (on PC).
